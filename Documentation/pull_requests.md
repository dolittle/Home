All of the Dolittle repositories are [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)
based. That means that nothing gets into any of the repositories without it being a pull request first.

The pull request as a gated concept means that we get to do code reviews and make sure the pull request adheres
to the [definition of done]({{< relref definition_of_done >}}).

## Remotes and Forks
Contributers with access to a repository can send pull requests on the specific repository. For others, create your own fork and submit a pull request from the forked repository.

## Delete branch after accepted pull request
After a pull request had been successfully merged, remember to delete the remote branch.

## Open a draft pull request
We encourage opening a [draft pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) to create a space to discuss the work being done and get feedback early in the process. It's a lot easier to change a design that is being evolved that one that is "final"
