All of the Dolittle repositories are [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)
based. That means that nothing gets into any of the repositories without it being a pull request first.

The pull request as a gated concept means that we get to do code reviews and make sure the pull request adheres
to the [definition of done]({{< relref definition_of_done >}}).
