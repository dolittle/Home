We have a clear definition of what we consider to be done. These are the exit-criteria to determine if
an implementation is complete. The actual coding part is only part of what actual done is.
The definition of done is used actively when [pull requests]({{< relref pull_requests >}}) are reviewed.

This is our definition:

* Functional software
* Adhering to our [principles]({{< relref core_principles >}})
* Has automated specs for each unit
* Has API documentation (XML, JsDoc, etc..)
* Has general [documentation]({{< relref contributing/documentation >}})
* Ready to be deployed (NuGet, NPM, Maven, Docker, production software)
