## Code files

All code files **MUST** to have the following copyright header, this includes even automated test files for all languages. The format needs to adhere to the following.

```csharp
// Copyright (c) Dolittle. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the MIT license. See LICENSE file in the project root for full license information.
```

For XML based languages, this would look like:

```xml
<!--
 Copyright (c) Dolittle. All rights reserved.
 Licensed under the MIT license. See LICENSE file in the project root for full license information.
-->
```

Other languages might have other ways to represents comments, for instance bash/shell scripts or similar:

```shell
# Copyright (c) Dolittle. All rights reserved.
# Licensed under the MIT license. See LICENSE file in the project root for full license information.
```
