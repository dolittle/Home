You can contribute through the issues on any of the repositories in all the
organizations found listed [here](https://github.com/dolittle/home). If you
want to contribute with code, you can submit a pull request with your changes.
Before contributing with code, it is highly recommended to read through all of
our documentation here to see what we're expecting from you as a contributor.

This project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the
[Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) to clarify expected
behavior in our community. Read our [Code of Conduct]({{< relref code_of_conduct >}}).

Contributions can also be done through documentation, all of our repositories
have a `Documentation` folder and more details on writing documentation can be
found [here](/contributing/documentation).
