At Dolittle we believe that good software stems from a set of core values.
These values guides us towards our [core principles]({{< relref core_principles >}})
and also manifested in our [development principles]({{< relref development_principles >}})
that translates it into guidelines we use for our development.
This page describes these core values to help put ourselves into the pit of success.

## Privacy

We value privacy at all levels. Core to everything we do is rooted in this.
This means we will always strive towards making the right technology choice that
lets the owner of data have full control over where it is stored and the ownership
is always very clear. These things should always be at the back every developers
mind when making choices. It is easy to forget that even a little log statement
could violate this.

## Empowering developers

The Dolittle mission is to **empower developers to create great, sustainable,
maintainable software so that they can make their users feel like heroes**.
This is part of our DNA - representing how we think and how we approach every
aspect of our product development. Our products range from libraries to frameworks
to tooling, and every step of the way we try to make it as easy as possible
for the developer consuming our technology.

## Delivering business value

When empowering developers, this is because we want to make it easier to create
great technical solutions without having to implement all the nitty and gritty
details of doing so; so that our end-users - the developers we are building for,
can focus on delivering the business value for their businesses. For Dolittle the
developer using our technology is our end-users and represent our business value.
Our promise in this is that we will build relevant technology and not technology
for the technology sake. Obviously, this is balanced with innovation and we will
try out things, but close the feedback loop as tight as possible so that we try
things out and iterate on it to see if things are delivering business value.

## User focused

At the end of the day, whatever we are building and at any level - we build things
that affect an end user. There is always a person at the end of everything being
done. This is critical to remember. We build software to help people build software
that are more relevant and improves the lives of the actual end user using the
software.

With this in hand, we work hard to understand the persona; who are we building for
and what is the effect of building something.

## Embracing change

The world is constantly changing, so should software. Adapting to new knowledge,
new opportunities and new challenges is how the world has always moved on. It is
therefor a vital piece of Dolittle to be able to embrace this change. This is a
mindset and something we strongly believe in, and is also something we stribe
towards in our codebase; making it possible to adapt and change to new requirements
without having to recreate everything.
